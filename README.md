# Turnip-builds-for-Adreno-7xx
Just a place where I can post prebuilt Turnip drivers for various apps. Mainly for Adreno 7xx ONLY

DISCLAIMER!!!

I'm not a developer from Mesa team nor have any association with them. These drivers are straight up from either Mesa's Gitlab or Danil's Gitlab. I'm not gonna include any changes and don't ask for that.

Special thanks for Danil for working on Turnip driver for Adreno 7xx series GPUs. Lots of cool projects wouldn't be possible without your efforts.
Also huge thanks for Mesa team for their overall work and the whole Mesa3D project.
